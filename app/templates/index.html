                <p>
                    The only part they told us about entrepreneurship was that we would be our own bosses. They never told us that we would fail
                    many times before we succeed. They never told us that we would work 5 times more than our employees and
                    not get anything sometimes. They never told us that this would cripple our credit score. That we will
                    be in debt and owe alot of people money.
                    <p>No one said anything about the sleepless nights trying to figure out a way forward. No one told us
                        about the stress and anxiety. No one told us that this will cause conflict between us and or relatives,
                        and family members. No one told us that we would be jokes to the society especially when we start
                        changing from one business to another. No one told us that sometimes we will go six months or more
                        without any income. Living in the edge and surviving through borrowing money from different people.
                        No one told us that our doors would be shut down due failure to pay staff, they canâ€™t get to work.
                        No one told us we would be hobos at some point. No one told us that our husbands wives, boyfriends
                        and girlfriend's would leave us because they will not understand our journey. No one told us that
                        we will have to be more than patient. </p>
                    <p> That we would make so many mistakes end up losing alot of money. That at some point we would have
                        to risk our lives in order to move forward.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We had to figure this out all by ourselves. Many gave up on the journey. Some died on the journey. But some of us after going
                        through so much pain we decided that we were going to succeed or die trying . Some of us we are never
                        giving up on this no matter what. We are now doing it and very aware of the circumstances. It's win
                        or nothing for us and it's too late to go back now. We are entrepreneurs!!
